<h1 class="title">5D Painting</h1>

<p>
    5D painting I find takes patience, a lot of it at most times. For some this would be the last thing that they would attempt as a stress reliever, which is perfectly ok. I personally enjoy this one because I can complete it at my own pace and I can also set it down at anytime and pick it right back up knowing where I left off. Due to the size of these little diamonds others may get fustrated or just may not be able to see what exactly is going on. But with this being said we will jump over to the original coloring and painting styles.
